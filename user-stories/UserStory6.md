# User Story 6: Enhanced Interaction with Past Inquiries for Improved Responses

**Title:** *Dynamic Feedback and Response Revision for Account-Linked Inquiries*

**Narrative:**

As **Friend F**, an existing user, I want the ability to log into my account, review past inquiries and responses, update my feedback if necessary, and request further clarification or a new response to ensure that my legal needs are fully met.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Account Access and History Review:**
   - Friend F logs into the website using her account credentials.
   - She navigates to a page that displays her previous legal inquiries and responses.
   - She selects a specific inquiry to review the associated response.

2. **Updating Feedback and Requesting New Response:**
   - Upon reviewing, Friend F decides the initial response was inadequate.
   - She changes her feedback on the response to reflect her current view.
   - Friend F requests another response, specifying additional criteria or clarifications needed.

3. **Receiving Revised Response and Record Keeping:**
   - The system processes the updated request and criteria, and a revised response is generated.
   - Friend F receives this new response, and it is stored in the database linked with the original query.
   - Both the original and the new response, along with the updated feedback, are accessible in Friend F’s account for future reference.

**Notes:**

- The user interface should facilitate easy navigation to past inquiries and intuitive interaction for updating feedback.
- The system must be capable of handling dynamic changes in user feedback and efficiently processing requests for additional responses.
- It is crucial to maintain a comprehensive record of all interactions linked to the user’s account for transparency and continuity.
- Ensuring data privacy and security in storing and updating user information and feedback is paramount.

_This user story emphasizes the importance of continuous engagement with users, allowing them to revisit and reassess responses to their inquiries, thereby ensuring their evolving legal needs are adequately addressed._
