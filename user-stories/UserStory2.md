As **Friend B**, a user with a legal query related to criminal law, I want to ensure my inquiry is accurately categorized and responded to by the appropriate legal expert, even if my initial categorization is incorrect. Furthermore, I want the response to meet certain quality standards as set by stakeholders.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Initial Submission and Category Selection:**
   - Friend B accesses the website and selects "Criminal Law" from a categorized menu to submit their legal query.
   - Upon submission, a notification is sent to a lawyer specializing in criminal law.

2. **Category Correction and Expert Forwarding:**
   - The criminal law lawyer, upon reviewing the query, identifies it as more appropriate for medical law and forwards it to a medical law specialist.
   - This re-categorization process should be seamless and efficient, ensuring minimal delay.

3. **Response, Review, and Revision:**
   - The medical law specialist drafts a response to the query.
   - The response is initially vetoed by a stakeholder, who provides specific feedback on how it should be amended to better meet quality standards.
   - The medical lawyer revises and resends the response, incorporating the suggested changes.

4. **Final Feedback and Data Storage:**
   - The revised response is approved by the stakeholder and sent to Friend B.
   - Friend B reviews the response and provides a neutral rating, reflecting their satisfaction level.
   - The entire process, including the initial query, the responses, the stakeholder's feedback, and Friend B's rating, is recorded and stored in the database for future reference and quality improvement.
