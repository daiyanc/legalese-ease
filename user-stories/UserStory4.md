# User Story 4: Efficient Handling of Repeated Legal Inquiries

**Title:** *Automated Response for Recognized Repeated Queries*

**Narrative:**

As **Friend D**, a user with a query potentially similar to previously asked questions, I want the system to quickly identify and provide a high-quality, pre-approved response, ensuring efficiency and consistency in the advice I receive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Query Submission and Category Selection:**
   - Friend D accesses the website, selects the "Other" category, and submits her legal query.
   - The system is designed to intelligently recognize and categorize user inquiries.

2. **Automated Query Recognition and Response Retrieval:**
   - The database automatically recognizes Friend D's inquiry as a repeated query.
   - It then retrieves a pre-existing response that has previously received positive feedback (a thumbs up rating) for a similar query.

3. **Response Delivery and User Feedback:**
   - Friend D promptly receives the automated response, ensuring a quick turnaround time.
   - Upon reviewing the response, Friend D is satisfied and gives a thumbs up rating.

4. **Feedback Recording and Data Utilization:**
   - The feedback provided by Friend D is captured and stored in the database.
   - This data is used to further refine the query recognition system and validate the effectiveness of automated responses.

**Notes:**

- The system should be capable of accurately identifying repeated queries to leverage existing high-quality responses.
- User feedback is crucial in continuously assessing and improving the effectiveness of the automated response system.
- The process must prioritize user satisfaction while maintaining efficiency.
- Data privacy should be upheld in all interactions and data storage.

_This user story aims to streamline the response process for repeated inquiries, enhancing the user experience by providing quick, reliable, and previously validated legal advice._
